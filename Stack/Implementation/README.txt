Stack implementation:

-->using Arrays [Java(Vector)]
-maximum size of the array must be defined in advance and cannot be changed during the implementation
-need to check overflow and underflow

-->using ArrayList
-need to check underflow

-->using LinkedList(java implementation)
-push and pop at head

-->using Queue (lil complex)
-TC of push operation is O(n)
