InfixToPostfix:

Infix notation is a way of writing mathematical expressions in which the operators are placed between the operands, such as "2 + 3" or "5 * (4 + 2)". Postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish notation, is a way of writing mathematical expressions in which the operators are placed after the operands, such as "2 3 +" or "5 4 2 + *".

One way to convert an infix expression to postfix notation is to use a stack data structure. The algorithm works as follows:

1.Initialize an empty stack and an empty output list.

2.Read the infix expression from left to right.

3.If the current character is an operand, add it to the output list.

4.If the current character is an operator, pop operators from the stack and add them to the output list until an operator of lower precedence is found or the stack is empty. Then push the current operator onto the stack.

5.If the current character is a left parenthesis, push it onto the stack.

6.If the current character is a right parenthesis:

Pop operators from the stack and add them to the output list until a left parenthesis is encountered.
Pop and discard the left parenthesis.

7.Repeat steps 2-6 until the entire infix expression has been read.

8.Pop any remaining operators from the stack and add them to the output list.

Note: Infix to postfix conversion is also known as Shunting Yard algorithm.
