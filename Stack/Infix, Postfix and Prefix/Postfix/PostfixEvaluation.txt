PostfixEvaluation:

1.Initialize an empty stack.
2.Scan the postfix expression from left to right.
3.If the scanned character is an operand, push it to the stack.
4.If the scanned character is an operator, pop two operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back to the stack.
5.Repeat steps 2-4 until all characters are scanned.
6.The result will be the top element of the stack, which can be popped and returned.
